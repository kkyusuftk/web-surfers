1. Always use `pnpm` for the projects
2. Always cd into the scaffolded projects before making new changes
3. Do not start the dev server again. I have it running in a different terminal already. Once changes are done just say it is done, I will run the server and check it out.
4. Please confirm with me before making any change outside the src folder
5. Confrim before making a web search
